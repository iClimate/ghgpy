The converter Python package helps you perform various unit conversions. Before using the package, you need to install it on your system. You can do it by using pip: pip install python-unitconverterermac Inside of your python script you can now import the converter from the unitconverter package: # your_script.py from unitconverter import converter After you've imported the package, you can use it to perform various unit conversions: # your_script.py from unitconverter import converter print(converter.convertLength(20, \"m\", \"cm\")) # OUTPUT: 200.0 print(converter.convertWeight(5, \"kilogram\", \"g\")) # OUTPUT: 5000.0 You can also import conversion functions for specific units: # your_script.py from unitconverter.converter import convertLength You can then call the specific function to convert units: # your_script.py from unitconverter.converter import convertLength print(convertLength(5, \"meter\", \"centimeter\")) # OUTPUT: 500.0 Modules available for conversion include: convertLength , convertWeight , convertVolume , convertPressure , convertEnergy , convertData , convertSpeed , convertTime , convertTemperature","title":"Getting Started"},{"location":"getting_started/#how-to-convert-units","text":"The converter Python package helps you perform various unit conversions.
